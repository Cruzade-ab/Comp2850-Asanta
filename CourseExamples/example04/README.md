## Icons Class

Icons are identified by their name as listed below, e.g. Icons.airplanemode_on.

Search and find the perfect icon on the Google Fonts website.

To use this class, make sure you set **uses-material-design: true in your project's pubspec.yaml file** in the flutter section. This ensures that the Material Icons font is included in your application. This font is used to display the icons.
